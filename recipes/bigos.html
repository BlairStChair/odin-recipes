       <li>1 lb Polish sausage (kielbasa), sliced</li>
       <li>1 lb beef stew meat, cubed</li>
       <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
       <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
       <li>1 cup sauerkraut, drained and rinsed</li>
       <li>1 cup shredded cabbage</li>
       <li>1 cup chopped mushrooms</li>
       <li>1 can (14.5 oz) diced tomatoes</li>
       <li>1 cup beef broth</li>
       <li>1 bay leaf</li>
       <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
       <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
       <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Brown the Meats:</h3><p>In a large pot or Dutch oven, brown the sliced sausage and cubed beef 
            stew meat over medium heat <br>until nicely browned. Remove from the pot and set aside.</p></li>
        <li><h3>Sauté the Vegetables:</h3><p>In the same pot, add chopped onion and minced garlic. 
            Sauté until the onion is soft and translucent.<br>
            Add chopped mushrooms and shredded cabbage to the pot. Cook for a few minutes until the mushrooms are softened.</p></li>
        <li><h3>Combine Ingredients:</h3><p>Return the browned meats to the pot.
            Add drained sauerkraut, diced tomatoes (with their juices), <br>beef broth, 
            bay leaf, dried thyme, and paprika. Stir to combine.</p></li>
        <li><h3>Simmer:</h3><p>Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium-low heat.
            Cover and let it simmer for at least 1 hour, stirring occasionally.<br> The longer it simmers, 
            the more the flavors will develop. You can simmer for up to 2-3 hours for even richer flavor.</p></li>
        <li><h3>Season:</h3><p>Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper if needed.
            Remove the bay leaf before serving.</p></li>
        <li><h3>Serve:</h3><p>Serve hot, either on its own or with crusty bread or boiled potatoes.
            Bigos is often even better the next day,<br> as the flavors have more time to meld together.</p></li>
