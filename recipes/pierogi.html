       <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
       <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
       <li>1 large egg</li>
       <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
       <li>1/4 cup butter, softened</li>
       <li>1 cup mashed potatoes (you can also add cheese, onions, or other fillings if desired)</li>
       <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
       <li>Optional toppings: sautéed onions, sour cream, chopped bacon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Prepare the Dough:</h3><p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg, sour cream, and softened butter until well combined.<br>
            Gradually add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, stirring until a dough forms.
            Knead the dough<br> on a floured surface for about 5 minutes, until smooth. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest for 15-20 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><h3>Prepare the Filling:</h3><p>Mix mashed potatoes with any desired fillings such as cheese, onions, or seasonings. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p></li>
        <li><h3>Assemble the Pierogi:</h3><p>Roll out the dough on a floured surface to about 1/8 inch thickness.
            Use a round cookie cutter or a glass to cut out circles of dough.<br>
            Place a small spoonful of filling in the center of each dough circle.
            Fold the dough over the filling to create a half-moon shape,<br> then pinch the edges firmly to seal. You can use a fork to crimp the edges for extra security.</p></li>
        <li><h3>Cook the Pierogi:</h3><p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
            Carefully drop the pierogi into the boiling water, working in batches to avoid overcrowding.<br>
            Boil the pierogi for about 3-5 minutes, or until they float to the surface.
            Remove the pierogi with a slotted spoon and transfer them to a plate.</p></li>
        <li><h3>Optional: Fry the Pierogi (for extra flavor):</h3><p>In a skillet, melt some butter over medium heat.
            Add the boiled pierogi to the skillet and fry until golden brown on both sides,<br> about 2-3 minutes per side.
            Remove from the skillet and drain on paper towels.</p></li>
        <li><h3>Serve:</h3><p>Serve the pierogi hot, topped with sautéed onions, a dollop of sour cream, and chopped bacon if desired.
            Enjoy your delicious homemade pierogi!</p></li>
